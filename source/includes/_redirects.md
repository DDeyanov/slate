# Booking Redirects

In addition to price information, your users will need a url that redirects them to where they can book their ticket. 

You can either:

* redirect your users to the Skyscanner website 
* redirect them directly to the supplier's website (airline or travel agent)

<aside class="notice" >
  We recommend that you redirect users to Skyscanner's website as this helps with trust and therefore will enhance your conversion rate. For more information please see <a href="#improving-your-conversions">improving your conversions</a>

## To Skyscanner

Link to the Skyscanner website with the details of the search query pre-populated. This provides a more straightforward option for partners who do not require a full implementation of a travel search product within their applications.

If the query isn't specific enough to link to a specific 'day view' page, it will link to a more general browse page, where the user will be asked to refine the search criteria (by date, origin and/or destination).


```shell
GET "http://partners.api.skyscanner.net/apiservices/
    referral/v1.0/{country}/{currency}/{locale}/
    {originPlace}/{destinationPlace}/
    {outboundPartialDate}/{inboundPartialDate}
    ?apiKey={shortApiKey}"
```

## To the supplier


When using [flights live prices](#flights-live-prices) or [car hire live prices](#car-hire-live-prices) urls (or deeplinks) are provided in the response to take the user straight through to the supplier's website.

These urls are an unbranded version of Skyscannerâ€™s own deeplinking service that redirects users to the third-party supplier's website with the details of the itinerary that was selected. 

![deeplink page](/images/deeplink.png)

You can customise the redirect page by replacing the default logo with your own logo. Please see [How can I put my logo on the redirect page?](https://support.business.skyscanner.net/hc/en-us/articles/208180985-How-can-I-put-my-logo-on-the-redirect-page-) for more information.

<aside class="notice">
Skyscanner has no control over the third-party website. In some cases the selected itinerary will be ready to book. In other cases the search criteria will be pre-populated but the end-user will have to search through the results to find their itinerary.

<aside class="warning">
Please <b>do not cache the deeplinks</b> as they are only valid while your session is active. Once the session has timed out you will need to create a new session and refresh all the results and deeplink urls.
