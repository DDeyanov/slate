# Authentication

Skyscanner uses API keys to allow access to the APIs. You can create API keys through your [Skyscanner account](http://portal.business.skyscanner.net/en-gb/accounts/login/). Simply click 'Travel APIs' and enter your app name.

You must include the API key in all API requests to the server, either as a parameter in the query or in the query header. Please refer to each endpoint for details.
